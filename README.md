67272 Chess Store Project: Phase 5
===

Hello,

   Here are two of the main decisions I made when designing this website:
        - I chose not to use use any images on the employee pages in order to keep the pages as simple as possible; They see the website every day and do not need extraneous information.
        - I chose not to allow many priveleges to users so that their time spent on the site would be as streamlined as possible.
Thank you,
Bernard Decelian
